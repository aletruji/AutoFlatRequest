Smart Rental Application Assistant

Finding an apartment in cities like Berlin is a race against timeâ€”good listings are often gone within minutes. 

This program automates the application process by monitoring incoming emails for new offers, extracting the relevant links, 
and instantly submitting applications on behalf of you and your roommates. 

Running in the cloud or on a Raspberry Pi, it ensures you never miss an opportunity due to slow reaction time.
